                answer: "The Mirai botnet infects IoT devices (like cameras, routers) by scanning for devices using default or weak factory usernames and passwords. Once it gains access, it installs malware. These compromised devices then form a large network (botnet) which can be commanded to launch Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In 2016, Mirai was used to flood target servers (like Dyn, a major DNS provider) with massive amounts of traffic, overwhelming them and making websites and online services inaccessible."

                question: "5. Explain how the Black Energy malware was used in the cyberattack on the Ukrainian power station.",
                answer: "The attack typically involved several stages: <strong>Initial Access:</strong> Attackers often used spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments (e.g., infected Microsoft Office documents) sent to employees of the power company. <strong>Malware Deployment:</strong> Opening the attachment executed the Black Energy malware (specifically, versions like BlackEnergy 3), which established a backdoor on the infected system. <strong>Reconnaissance & Lateral Movement:</strong> The attackers used the foothold to explore the network, steal credentials, and gain access to the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) / SCADA network managing the power grid. <strong>Disruption:</strong> Once they had control, they remotely manipulated circuit breakers to disconnect substations, causing widespread power outages. They also deployed destructive components (like KillDisk) to wipe data from operator workstations and disable systems, hindering recovery efforts, and launched a telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) attack against the call center."

                question: "6. What are the key components of a security mechanism designed to ensure data integrity?",
                answer: "Key components include: <strong>Hashing Algorithms:</strong> Functions (like SHA-256, MD5 - though MD5 is weak) that produce a fixed-size digest (hash) of the data. Any change to the data results in a different hash, allowing detection of tampering. <strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Uses asymmetric cryptography. A hash of the data is encrypted with the sender's private key. The recipient uses the sender's public key to decrypt the hash and compares it with a hash they compute themselves. This verifies both integrity and authenticity (non-repudiation). <strong>Checksums:</strong> Simpler error-detection methods (often used for accidental corruption rather than malicious tampering) that calculate a numerical value based on the data block. <strong>Access Controls:</strong> Preventing unauthorized users from modifying data in the first place. <strong>Version Control Systems:</strong> Tracking changes to data or code over time, allowing detection of unauthorized modifications and rollback if needed. <strong>Message Authentication Codes (MACs):</strong> Similar to hashes but use a shared secret key, providing integrity and some level of authenticity between parties sharing the key."

                answer: "<strong>Role:</strong> Availability ensures that systems, applications, and data are accessible and operational for authorized users whenever they need them. It's about preventing disruption and ensuring business continuity. Lack of availability can halt operations, cause financial loss, and damage reputation. <strong>Ensuring Availability:</strong> This involves implementing: <strong>Redundancy:</strong> Deploying redundant components (servers, network links, power supplies, RAID storage) so that if one fails, another takes over. <strong>High Availability (HA) Clustering:</strong> Grouping servers to work together, providing failover capabilities. <strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Creating copies of data that can be restored in case of loss or corruption. <strong>Disaster Recovery (DR) Plans:</strong> Having procedures and potentially alternate sites to recover operations after a major incident (fire, flood, cyberattack). <strong>Patch Management:</strong> Keeping systems updated to prevent outages caused by vulnerabilities. <strong>Performance Monitoring & Load Balancing:</strong> Ensuring systems can handle expected load and distributing traffic efficiently. <strong>DDoS Protection:</strong> Defending against attacks designed to overwhelm services (as mentioned in Q7)."

                question: "9. Explain the concept of a passive attack and provide an example.",
                answer: "<strong>Concept:</strong> A passive attack is a type of security intrusion where the attacker monitors, intercepts, or collects information from a target system or network communication without modifying the data or affecting the system's operation. The primary goal is usually reconnaissance or data theft, and these attacks are often difficult to detect because they don't cause changes or disruptions. <strong>Example:</strong> An attacker using a network sniffer tool (like Wireshark) on an unsecured Wi-Fi network to capture unencrypted data packets. They might intercept login credentials, emails, or sensitive files being transmitted between users on that network, without altering the traffic or alerting the users."

                question: "1. Discuss the importance of the CIA triad in information security. How do confidentiality, integrity, and availability work together to protect data?",
                answer: "<strong>Importance:</strong> The CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the foundational model for information security policy and practice. It provides a framework for identifying security needs, assessing risks, and implementing controls. Neglecting any one aspect can leave data vulnerable. <strong>How they work together:</strong> These principles are interconnected and often require balancing. <strong>Confidentiality</strong> ensures only authorized individuals can access sensitive data (achieved via encryption, access controls). <strong>Integrity</strong> ensures data is accurate, trustworthy, and unaltered (achieved via hashing, digital signatures, version control). <strong>Availability</strong> ensures authorized users can access data and systems when needed (achieved via redundancy, backups, disaster recovery). For example, strong encryption (Confidentiality) is useless if the decryption key is lost or the system holding the data is down (Availability). Data that is always available but easily modified by anyone lacks Integrity. Accurate data (Integrity) kept confidential is meaningless if it cannot be accessed when required (Availability). Together, they provide a comprehensive approach to securing data and systems against various threats."

                answer: "<strong>Difference:</strong> As defined previously, active attacks modify or disrupt systems/data, while passive attacks observe or collect information without altering the target. <strong>Examples & Impact:</strong><br><strong>Active Attack (e.g., Ransomware, DDoS):</strong> <i>Impact:</i> Immediate and often severe. Ransomware halts operations, risks data loss, incurs ransom costs, and causes reputational damage. DDoS attacks make services unavailable, leading to lost revenue and customer frustration. Active attacks are generally easier to detect due to their disruptive nature.<br><strong>Passive Attack (e.g., Eavesdropping, Traffic Analysis):</strong> <i>Impact:</i> Often subtle and long-term. Eavesdropping can lead to the theft of sensitive information (credentials, intellectual property, personal data) over time, resulting in financial loss, competitive disadvantage, or regulatory breaches. Traffic analysis can reveal communication patterns or organizational structures. Passive attacks are harder to detect as they don't directly interfere with normal operations."

                answer: "<strong>Role:</strong> Encryption is a primary mechanism for ensuring confidentiality. It transforms plaintext data into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key. Only someone possessing the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext back into readable plaintext. This protects data from being understood by unauthorized parties, even if they gain physical or network access to it (e.g., stolen laptop, intercepted network traffic). It applies to data at rest (stored) and data in transit (transmitted).<br><br><strong>Advantages:</strong><br><strong>Strong Protection:</strong> Provides robust defense against unauthorized access and data breaches.<br><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Helps meet requirements of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).<br><strong>Data Integrity (indirectly):</strong> Some encryption modes (authenticated encryption) can also provide integrity checks.<br><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Enables secure transmission of sensitive data over insecure networks (like the internet via TLS/SSL).<br><br><strong>Disadvantages:</strong><br><strong>Performance Overhead:</strong> Encryption and decryption consume processing power, which can impact system performance, especially for large volumes of data or high-speed communication.<br><strong>Key Management Complexity:</strong> Securely generating, distributing, storing, rotating, and revoking encryption keys is crucial and complex. Lost keys can mean permanent data loss. Compromised keys negate the encryption's value.<br><strong>Implementation Challenges:</strong> Correctly implementing encryption can be difficult; errors can lead to weak or ineffective protection.<br><strong>Cost:</strong> May involve costs for specialized hardware (HSMs), software licenses, or management tools.<br><strong>Impact on Availability:</strong> If keys are lost or systems managing encryption fail, data can become inaccessible."

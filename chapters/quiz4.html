                question: "Differentiate encryption/decryption and digital signatures in public-key cryptography.",
                answer: "Encryption/decryption ensures confidentiality by encrypting data with the recipient's public key and decrypting with their private key. Digital signatures provide authentication and integrity by signing data (or a hash of data) with the sender's private key, verifiable with the sender's public key."
            },

                question: "Why is public key cryptography preferred for key exchange in protocols like TLS?",
                answer: "It allows secure symmetric key exchange over insecure networks without sharing secret keys beforehand, reducing key distribution risks and enabling secure session establishment."
            },
             { // Page 13, Q4
                question: "Discuss the importance of secure defaults in software products.",
                answer: "Many users do not change default settings; secure defaults (e.g., strong passwords, disabling risky features, unique configuration values) reduce vulnerabilities and widespread attacks, improving security for all users."

                question: "Explain the concept of threat modeling in secure software development.",
                answer: "Threat modeling identifies potential security threats early in the development process, allowing developers to design mitigations proactively and reduce vulnerabilities before code is written or deployed."
            },
             { // Page 13, Q6
                question: "How does multi-factor authentication enhance security?",
                answer: "It requires multiple verification methods (e.g., password plus token, biometric plus PIN), making unauthorized access more difficult even if one factor (like a password) is compromised."
            },
             { // Page 13, Q7
                question: "What role does patch management play in secure computing?",
                answer: "Patch management fixes security vulnerabilities by applying updates (patches) promptly, preventing exploitation of known weaknesses by attackers."
            },
            { // Page 13, Q8
                question: "Describe the principle of defense in depth.",
                answer: "Defense in depth uses multiple layers of security controls (e.g., firewalls, encryption, access controls, intrusion detection) so that if one layer fails, others still protect the system, reducing the likelihood of a successful breach."
            },
            { // Page 13, Q9
                question: "Discuss the importance of secure coding standards.",
                answer: "Secure coding standards (e.g., rules for input validation, error handling, memory management, authentication) help prevent common vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of exploitation and improving overall software security and reliability."
